# Comparing Teenage Birth Rates of Young Women from Low-Income Families in Baltimore, MD and Miami, FL Using Python

## Background
The article [Socioeconomic Disadvantage as a Social Determinant of Teen Childbearing in the U.S.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562742/) finds that "unfavorable socioeconomic conditions" are a contributing factor to high teen birth rates in the US. Teenage births are associated with adverse outcomes for both child --preterm birth, low birthweight, and infant death-- and mother, depending on her specific circumstances.  

This topic is interesting because although teenage birth rates in the US have decreased, the _absolute_ teenage birth rate is still high. In 2010, the teenage birth rate was a low 34.3 births per 1,000 people. However, absolute teenage births were still high at 370,000 total teenage births in the same year. Further research is necessary to tackle the factors that influence teen pregnancy and to identify any possible interventions. 

This project explores open data from the Opportunity Atlas Group on teenage birth rates of females from low-income families in Baltimore, MD and Miami, FL. The data takes teenage birth rates from tracts within neighborhoods in each city; several tracts can make up a neighborhood.
